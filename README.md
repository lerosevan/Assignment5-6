This assignment 5 was created by Evangelos Leros, Jahaira Flores, and Marisol Alvira Reynoso.

We all used the same solution, while adding in our own components. We did this to make our process for Assignment 6 easier, when we will work together. All of the components for this project were
created individually, as we only used the same solution. The following components were created:

Evangelos Leros:
1. EncryptionHelper.cs (file for encrypting the string)
2. TryIt.aspx.cs (file that sets and gets a cookie)

Jahaira Flores:
1. 


Marisol Alvira Reynoso:
